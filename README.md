## Features
 - Displays the collections as a list: no more cropped names.
 - Can optionally display unknown collections.
 - Displays the number of items in a collection, including how many can be added from the inventory.
 - Ability to filter complete, incomplete or unknown collections.
 - Can sort collections by game order, name, or status (collections with missing items present in the inventory are listed first).
 - Quickly find a collection by name using the search box.
 - Clearly displays which items are inside the collection or can be added from the inventory.
 - Items can be added to the inventory in one click, directly from the collection window.
 
## Installation

1. Download the [latest release of Enhanced Collection](https://github.com/MrJul/ToS-EnhancedCollection/releases).
2. Extract the `☕enhancedcollection.ipf` file from the downloaded zip file and copy it to your Tree of Savior `data` folder (under *&lt;steam folder&gt;\steamapps\common\TreeOfSavior\data*).
3. Ensure the downloaded filename is correctly named `☕enhancedcollection.ipf` (the cup icon **must** be present for the addon to load).

Starting with v1.1.0, Enhanced Collection is now distributed as an IPF file, for easier installation.  
If you've previously installed this add-on when it wasn't an IPF file, delete the `enhancedcollection` folder from your `addons` folder and remove the corresponding line from the `addonloader.lua` file.

## Uninstallation

Delete `☕enhancedcollection.ipf` from your Tree of Savior `data` folder.
